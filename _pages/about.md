I am a Professor of Mathematics at Central Michigan University.  Since August 2019, I have also served as Department Chair.  My research interests lie in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_combinatorics">algebraic combinatorics</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory">representation theory</a>; primarily in the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_base">crystal bases</a>.

Prior to coming to Central Michigan University, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the <a href="https://icerm.brown.edu">Institute of Computational and Experimental Mathematics</a> at <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/math/">Brown University</a> during the thematic semester entitled "<a href="https://icerm.brown.edu/programs/sp-s13/">Automorphic Forms, Combinatorial Representation Theory and Multiple Dirichlet Series</a>", where my postdoctoral mentor was <a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~anne/">Anne Schilling</a> from <a href="https://www.math.ucdavis.edu">UC Davis</a>.
In Fall 2013, I held a postdoctoral fellowship from  <a href="https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu">The City College of New York</a>, where my mentors was <a href="https://chinta.ccny.cuny.edu">Gautam Chinta</a>.
In 2012, I earned by Ph.D. in Mathematics at the <a href="https://math.uconn.edu">University of Connecticut</a> under the direction of <a href="https://automorphy.github.io/al-folio/">Kyu-Hwan Lee</a>.
