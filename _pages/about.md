Welcome to my page!  I am a Professor of Mathematics at Central Michigan University.  Since August 2019, I have also served as Department Chair.  My research interests lie in algebraic combinatorics and representation theory; primarily in the theory of crystal bases.

Before coming to CMU, I held postdoc positions at ICERM and CCNY.  In 2012, I earned by Ph.D. in Mathematics at the University of Connecticut under the direction of Kyu-Hwan Lee.
