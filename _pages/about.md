Converted mathematician from academia to data scientist in industry.  

The journey from academia to industry included great advice from many people.  I would love the opportunity to pay-it-forward and help anyone else work out which path is right for them and perhaps even have some advice about how to achieve it.  If you ever would like to discuss, please reach out to me on LinkedIn and we can set up a meeting.  

Prior to becoming a data scientist, I ...
- was a Professor of [Mathematics](https://www.cmich.edu/colleges/se/math/Pages/default.aspx) and Department Chair at [Central Michigan University](https://www.cmich.edu);
- was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Institute of Computational and Experimental Mathematics](https://icerm.brown.edu) at Brown University during the thematic semester entitled "[Automorphic Forms, Combinatorial Representation Theory and Multiple Dirichlet Series](https://icerm.brown.edu/programs/sp-s13/)", where my postdoctoral mentor was [Anne Schilling](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~anne/) from [UC Davis](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu);
- held a postdoctoral fellowship from [The City College of New York](https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu) in Fall 2013, where my mentor was [Gautam Chinta](https://chinta.ccny.cuny.edu); and
- earned by Ph.D. in Mathematics in 2012 at the [University of Connecticut](https://math.uconn.edu) under the direction of [Kyu-Hwan Lee]({{ site.links.KHL }}).

While a research mathematician, my research interests were in [algebraic combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_combinatorics) and [representation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory); primarily in the theory of [crystal bases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_base).
