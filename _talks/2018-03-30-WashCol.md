Abstract
----
In 1782 in *Recherches sur une nouvelle espèce de quarrés
magiques*, Leonhard Euler posed the following problem:

> Given $36$ officers of $6$ ranks and from $6$ regiments, can they be arranged
in a $6$-by-$6$ formation so that in each row and column there is one officer
of each rank and one officer from each regiment?

Euler conjectured that this was not possible, but it was not proven until
Gaston Tarry in 1901.  In more modern language, Euler's question is equivalent
to asking whether or not there exist two *orthogonal Latin squares* of
order $6$.  In fact, Euler conjectured that no pair of orthogonal Latin squares
of order $n$ exists, where $n = 6,10,14,\dots,4k+2,\ldots.$  However, this
conjecture was shown to be false for $n>6$ by R. C. Bose, S. S. Shrikhande,
and E. T. Parker in 1960.  In this talk, we will define the notion of a Latin
square of order $n$ and what it means for a pair of Latin squares to be
orthogonal, describe ways to construct Latin squares of order $n$, and
describe bounds on the largest number of orthogonal Latin squares of order $n$.
